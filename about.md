Burnout can lead people to disengage from the things they care about, whether that is work, family, community service, etc. Your voice is too important to let that happen...which is why this site was created.

The goal of RageQuit.tips is to be both a place for people to share their experiences with burnout and a place to go for resources on coping with burnout. Burnout is something that affects all sorts of people in all sorts of industries. Thus, the site was designed to allow anyone to contribute - to post to the blog, add resources or even make changes to the structure of the site.

The site was created by [Brian Rinaldi](https://twitter.com/remotesynth), who works as a Developer Advocate for [Stackbit](https://www.stackbit.com/). He has seen the impact of burnout on himself and on colleagues in the technology industry and felt that he could provide a tool to help.
