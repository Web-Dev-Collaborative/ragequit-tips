I've been sitting on the idea for this site for about 3 years. I was in the middle of trying to deal with [my own experiences with burnout](http://localhost:8888/my-experience/) and I wished I had somewhere to look for strategies to cope with the feelings and, perhaps, somewhere to discuss them without judgement. So, I bought a domain name, and, as these things usually go, I sat on it for a very long time.

Recently, I decided it was time to finally build the site. It was partially spurred on by reading a [post by Chris Coyier](https://css-tricks.com/netlify-cms-open-authoring/) covering the open authoring on Netlify CMS. This struck me as a potentially perfect solution for the site I wanted to build.

Why? Well, I'm no expert on burnout. And my own experiences and the strategies I used, while they may have helped me, are not necessarily going to be applicable to others. But, if the community has the power to contribute and maintain it, perhaps it could grow into something better and more useful.

Well, I know this isn't some amazing origin story, but it did spur the creation of the site and I hope you find it helpful to you.
